Hi People! ðŸ‘‹

Let me show you my first Single Page Application that I did for individual project on Soy Henry Bootcamp. 

It's done with Javascript, CSS native (mostly), HTML, React, Redux, Node JS, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.

It's a videogames website which includes some functions like create new videogames, search games by name, alphabetic and rating order and filter by gender.

The data is extracted from the RAWG videogames API. 

To execute the app type "npm install" in both "client" and "api" folders. And then type "npm start" and wait browser to open the website. 

Hope you like it! I'm very open to constructive comments and opinions.
